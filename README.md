Python + Bottle + SQLAlchemy web app template
=============================================

A template for python + bottle + sqlalchemy web application.
Additionally packed with Javascript libraries and some extra goodies.

Includes users table, and basic CRUD operations to start with an administration area.

Modular templating structure (RoR/ERB-like) using Bottle's Simpletemplate engine.

Constant improvements added.

Note:
I've packed JS libraries for eventual offline development so consider loading all from CDNs to get the latest versions.
